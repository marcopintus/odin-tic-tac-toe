# odin-tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe game in which two people could challenge each other, or one person could go up against the AI. The AI has two difficulties: Random and Impossible. The Random AI difficulty randomly selects a free tile on the board, while the Impossible AI uses a minimax algorithm to select the best position in which to place the mark.

The minimax algorithm has been implemented with the help of the following article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/
